# ASD-Detection

## Abstract

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex
neuro-development disorder that impairs communication, societal interaction, and behavior. Early diagnosis greatly improves
the outcomes for individuals with the disorder, as it allows
for early intervention and therapy. The traditional methods
of diagnosis are often time-consuming, expensive and rely on
subjective evaluations. This research work presents a systematic
review of existing literature on the use of machine learning for
ASD detection and proposes a diagnostic tool, which uses transfer
learning techniques to improve the detection of ASD, and classify
individuals as either having or not having ASD.
